''' calling a function, passing in 3 arguments
{getList} ' ';5;<1...10>

''' start of function getList takes 3 arguments (i.e. ' ';5;<1...10>)
''' the ^^ gives it the feeling that its a top level function like in python
''' the {{}} makes sense to be the name, as this function is used above
''' <> in turn ends up being the number of arguments this function takes
^^{{getList}} <><><>
    ''' local variable list set to the first argument of ' '
    ''' <- has a GOlang feeling to it, passing the furst argument as the value to #list
    #list <- #1
    ''' now this looks like the start of a for loop... or a banana... not sure
    ''' so for i in 5?
    ++i #2 /
        ''' total local variable of 1...10
        ''' okay, its a banana... what the heck is going on here?
        #total <- #3.#i * 3
        ''' if total not in 5, 11 or 13
        ''' this was a process of elmination of my brain cells
        (#total !! 5,11,13)
            ''' append a space (or our first argument) along with
            ''' the output of split which would reutrn foo or bar
            ''' like in any language the + means add to, or concatinate.
            ''' in this case list is getting ' ' foo/bar added to it =)
            #list +<- #1 +<- {split} #total
    ''' end of loop
    /
    ''' return list
    ''' the ^ gave it away
    ^#list

''' start of function split, takes 1 argument
^^{{split}} <>
    ''' if the modulus of argument is not 0 then return foo else bar
    ''' feels like a regular approach to any language to see if the
    ''' value is odd or even
    (#1 % 2 >< 0)
        ^'foo'
    (OR)
        ^'bar'
''' should really be an end function notation here somewhere, but iono...
